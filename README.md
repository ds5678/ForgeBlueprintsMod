# Forge Blueprints Mod

This mod for *The Long Dark* allows you to craft additional items at the forge. Requires ModSettings.

## Features

1. The Prybar and Cooking Pot can now be crafted at a forge.
2. Their weights and crafting requirements can be adjusted.
3. The player can craft arrowheads more efficiently if they dedicate 3 hours to crafting.
4. In the unlikely event that a player acquires way too many arrowheads, they can be remade into scrap metal.

## Installation

1. If you haven't done so already, install MelonLoader by downloading and running [MelonLoader.Installer.exe](https://github.com/HerpDerpinstine/MelonLoader/releases/latest/download/MelonLoader.Installer.exe)
2. Download the latest version of `ForgeBlueprintsMod.dll` from the [releases page](https://github.com/ds5678/ForgeBlueprintsMod/releases)
3. Download the latest version of `ModSettings.dll` from its [release page](https://github.com/zeobviouslyfakeacc/ModSettings/releases)
4. Move `ForgeBlueprintsMod.dll` and `ModSettings.dll` into the Mods folder in your TLD install directory

## Known Issue

Cooking Pots are not 100% condition after crafting. I am investigating potential solutions.

## Note

This mod will conflict with any mod that adds a prybar or cooking pot blueprint.
